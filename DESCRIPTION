Description: Computational reproducibility is a critical component of modern open science. Methods 
    such as docker exist to containerise analyses, ensuring that operating systems and package versions 
    are recorded and can be recreated in order to rerun analyses. Setting up dockerfiles, however, is 
    a nontrivial task on top of a growing technical barrier to reproducible research. Binder is a 
    easy interface to produce a virtual machine within which to rerun analyses without requiring 
    installation or understanding of underlying containerisation principles. It does however still require 
    researchers to search through their code to find packages and version of packages used in the project. 
    This package seeks to make the bridge to using binder for analyses in R even simpler, by setting up
    the install.R file with all packages and version (both on CRAN and github) in one step. 
    The binder can also be launched right from R, without needing to manually input repository information
    into the mybinder.org interface.
